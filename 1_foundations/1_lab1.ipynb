      "- **Why?** Healthcare involves complex decision-making, personalized treatment plans, and continuous monitoring. Agentic AI could autonomously recommend treatments, schedule appointments, or monitor chronic conditions.\n",
      "- **Opportunity:** Build a system that manages patient care plans, predicts health risks, interacts with patients for compliance, and adjusts prescriptions or lifestyle advice based on real-time data.\n",

      "- **Why?** Financial markets are fast-moving and data-intensive. Agentic AI can autonomously analyze market conditions, execute trades, and rebalance portfolios without constant human oversight.\n",
      "- **Opportunity:** Create autonomous agents that manage investment portfolios with goals aligned to user risk tolerance, adapt to market changes, and optimize returns in real time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Autonomous Customer Support and Sales Agents**\n",
      "- **Why?** Businesses want to provide 24/7 support and personalized sales experiences. An agentic AI could autonomously handle complex customer interactions, upsell/cross-sell, and learn from interactions to improve.\n",
      "- **Opportunity:** Design AI agents that autonomously interact with customers via chat, email, or voice, resolve issues, and even identify sales opportunities personalized to customer behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Smart Energy Management**\n",
      "- **Why?** Energy grids and building energy systems require dynamic balancing to optimize usage and integrate renewable energy sources. Agentic AI can autonomously manage energy distribution and consumption.\n",
